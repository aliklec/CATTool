This program does the following:
1) aligns an English file and its Spanish translation paragraph-by-paragraph
2) compares that 1st English file to a 2nd (new) English file and looks for similar paragraphs (i.e. ones with overlapping words)
3) when similar paragraphs are found across the English files, the program prints the corresponding Spanish translation for the 1st English paragraph

To run the program, use the Test Files and make sure they are extracted and placed in the same directory as the Python notebook.

This program can be used with other .txt files as long as they are aligned in terms of number of paragraphs. Simply replace the filepaths in the notebook.
