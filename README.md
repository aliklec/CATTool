This program does the following:
1) aligns an English file and its Spanish translation paragraph-by-paragraph
2) compares that 1st English file to a 2nd (new) English file and looks for similar paragraphs (i.e. ones with overlapping words)
3) when similar paragraphs are found across the English files, the program prints the corresponding Spanish translation for the 1st English paragraph

Many professional translators use "computer-assisted translation tools" which do something along these lines, and I wanted to try writing such a program from scratch. The idea is that a Spanish translator might receive a new English file that has never been translated, but if they have translated similar English paragraphs in the past, it will be useful to look at the Spanish translations of those similar paragraphs.
